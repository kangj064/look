          I encoded the first 148ea, 4.8MiB of AirPods Pro images into a single

          total 148 i-frame frames by ffmpeg's <code>-intra</code> option. It
          makes much smoother frame changes.

    <h1>Brahms, Piano Trio No.1 in B Major, Op. 8 - 4th Mov/</h1>
    <p>
      Brahms' Piano Trio No. 1, 4th movement, is sometimes considered a piece
      inspired by his love for Clara Schumann. The second theme of this movement
      is believed to have been composed with inspiration from Beethoven's "An
      die ferne Geliebte" ("To the Distant Beloved") and is thought to
      encapsulate Brahms' affection and feelings for Clara Schumann. The
      relationship between Brahms and Clara Schumann was deep and complex, and
      traces of his inspiration from her can be found in his music. However, it
      is challenging to assert that music is solely about a particular theme or
      emotion. Art allows for various interpretations, and Brahms' music, like
      any other, can carry different meanings depending on individual
      interpretations and experiences.
